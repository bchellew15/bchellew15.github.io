I have an M.S. in astrophysics with experience in software development and scientific programming. I worked on an agile development team at Rubrik Inc., and I implemented machine learning algorithms for drug discovery based on linear algebra and probability at OpenEye Scientific Software. I'm proficient in Python and C++ with extensive coursework in object-oriented programming. I participated in astronomy research at UC Santa Barbara resulting in a first-author publication in The Astrophysical Journal; I worked with telescope data, using NumPy and SciPy for statistics and model fitting, and numerically integrated for radiative transfer calculations.
